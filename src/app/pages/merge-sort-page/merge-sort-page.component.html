        <h2>Merge Sort</h2>
        <p>
            The merge sort algorithm is a sorting algorithm with the divide and conquer technique,
            which is nothing more than dividing an unordered list in smaller and smaller parts to then sort them and put
            them all together resulting in the sorting of the array,
            so if we pass a list like: 2,3,1, this algorithm will return the list in order like this: 1,2,3 
        </p>

        <h3>How does the algorithm work?</h3>
        <p>
            This algorithm works a bit similar to the <a href='/algorithm/Quicksort'>Quick-sort</a> algorithm which you can see by clicking on it.
            Merge sort algorithm collects an initial value which will be an unordered list as for example [3,5,1,2,4] 
            then what it will do is to divide the list in half that is to say that it will extract two lists from the list 
            that we send then following with the example now it would be like this: [3,5,1] and [2,4] since the list 
            is divided in two lists, this process is repeated again and again in a recursive way until only a single element remains, 
            something like this: [3] [5] [1] [2] [4]. Once this is done, the algorithm starts the second phase by merging and sorting 
            two closer lists. The smallest element will be pushed into the new empty list first, effectively sorting the matrix step 
            by step: [3,5] [1] [2,4] and then repeats the process looking like this: [1,3,5] [2,4] and so on until it is sorted 
            [1,2,3,4,5].
